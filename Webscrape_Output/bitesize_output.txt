 Suppose you were in the middle of nowhere, and there were no signs or landmarks to help you find your way. , Would you know how to find your way home? , Someone might tell you via phone or radio to 'walk to your left', or 'turn through \({60}^\circ\) and then start walking', but how would they know which way you were pointing in the first place?, One way of describing direction from a point is to use three-figure bearings., A compass always points north. Bearings are measured from the north line, always in a clockwise direction., So when someone tells you to walk on a bearing of \({120}^\circ\), you should face north, turn clockwise through \({120}^\circ\) and start walking., Bearings are always described using three figures., So for less than 100° put an appropriate number of 0s in front, eg 020°, 037°, 002°, 007°., An aeroplane takes off from Belfast International airport, as shown in the diagram below., The angle between the north line and the flight path of the aeroplane is \({30}^\circ\). , So we can say that the aeroplane is flying on a bearing of \({030}^\circ\) from Belfast International airport., A ship sails from a harbour H to a port P, as shown in the diagram., To calculate the bearing subtract \(50^\circ\) from \(360^\circ\) to find the reflex angle (labelled H) as bearings must be given in a clockwise direction from north., The direction the shipped sailed can be given as a bearing of \(310^\circ\)., Newry lies to the SW of Downpatrick., What is the compass direction south-east as a bearing?, \(135^\circ\), The flight path for Hamad’s drone is shown in the diagram., What is the bearing of the flight path?, \(097^\circ\), The diagram shows a ship, S which is sailing towards a harbour at B. , What is the bearing of its line of travel?, \(042^\circ\), Ava is walking from the lighthouse, L, to the campsite at C., What bearing does she need to follow on her compass?, \(135^\circ\), An aeroplane, positioned at A on the diagram, is flying back to its base at B. , What bearing is the pilot following?, \(235^\circ\), An aeroplane is travelling due North and then swings around to travel in a north-westerly direction as shown in the diagram, What is the bearing of the flight path now?, \(315^\circ\)
